# Web-Development-Notes

> Disclaimer: This repo contains work which is either in *English* or *Spanish*, sometimes both, sometimes *Spanglish* -hopefully not, but it may be-. If you find some notes that for example are in Spanish and would like to see them translated in English, or vice versa. Let me know, and I'll do it.

This is a collection of notes for Web Development that I take when I'm going through a book, course, or documentation.


I try to divide them in languages, technologies or specific features that I find interesting.

Bear in mind, they are not intended as a learning material itself but as a support for my work and talks -to help me remember what I go through. Hence, they might be incomplete or cryptic. 

Feel free to use, copy, fork, open an issue, send a PR, do a double barrel, etc.

Basically, share the ♥️ for the web technologies.
