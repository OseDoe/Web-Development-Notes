#Â Advanced TypeScript

## Numeric Separators with large numbers

```typescript
const largeNum = 1_234_567_890;
```

## Safer class usage with strict property initialization

In our tsconfig.json

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "strictPropertyInitialziation": true,
        "strictNullCheck": true
    }
}
```

Then we can use an exclamation mark at the end of our variable to specify that it won't be undefined.

```typescript
class RandomClass {
    titrandomVariable!: string[];

    constructor() {
    }
}
```

## "In" operator for automatic type inference

```typescript
interface Human {
    speak: string;
}

interface Dog {
    sound: string;
}


function makeSound(being: Dog | Human) {
    if ("speak" in being) {
        // code
    }
}
```

## Infer TypeScript types in switch statements

Making a variable _readonly_ and not specifying the type of it will make it more specific that a generic type.

```typescript
class Example {
    readonly variable = 6; // type: 6, not number
}
```

Knowing this, in a reducer function we can indicate which actions is going to be able to do our code by writing down the Actions as types.

```typescript

interface Action {
    type: string;
}

class Add implements Action {
    readonly type = "Add";
    constructor(public payload: string) {}
}

type ReducerActions = Add | Remove;

function reducer(state, action: ReducerActions) {
    switch(action.type) {
        case "Add":
            // code
            break;
    }
}
```

The `never` type says that it will never occur, but to let that happen, we have to properly handle other use cases.

## Explicit and Readable Type Declarations with mapped Type Modifiers

We can tell an interface that all its values are going to be readonly.

```ts
interface RandomInterface {
    first: string;
    last: string;
    email: string;
    phone?: number;
}

type ReadOnlyRandomInterface {
    readonly [Key in keyof RandomInterface]: RandomInterface[Key];
}
```

We can do loads of things with this mapped types.

If we wanted to remove optional types, we will do `-`:

```ts
// Remove optional param
type ReadOnlyRandomInterface {
    readonly [Key in keyof RandomInterface]-?: RandomInterface[Key];
}
```

We can also use the `+` sign to add stuff.

## Types vs Interfaces

We tend to use types to alias different interfaces and join them into one, while we use interfaces in a more classic OOP way.

In reality both are really similar and most of the time can be used interchangeably. So for example, an interface can extend from another interface or a type.

A difference can be that interfaces support beind declared more than one time and they will convert into one in run time, while we can not do that with types.
