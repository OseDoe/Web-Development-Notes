# Inheritance

## Interfaces

An interface is a mechanism that let us define what properties and methods an object have to implement, and also define custom types.

```typescript
interface IExampleOne {
    id: number;
    name: string;
}

let object: IExampleOne;
object = { id: 1, name: 'pepe' };
```

### Optional parameters

If we don't want to implement all properties of an interface we can always declare optional parameters.

```typescript
interface IExampleWithOptions {
    id: number;
    name?: string
}
```

## Classes

A class in OOP is the definition of an object. Narrowing what information it holds and what actions can do.

Classes and Interfaces tend to work together in design patterns.

```typescript
class Car {
    wheels: number;
    drive(): void {
        console.log('Broom broom!');
    }
}
```

### Class properties

In order to access the properties of a class from within a class itself, we need to use the `this` keyword.

```typescript
class IdentityClass {
    id: number;
    logId: void {
        console.log(`The id is: ${this.id}`);
    }
}
```

## Interfaces vs Classes

We need to define each of these concepts:

-**Class:** Definition of an object, including properties and methods.
-**Interface:** Definition of a custom type, including properties and methods.

The difference is that classes must implement methods and properties, whereas interfaces only describe them. Hence, we can use interfacesto describe common behaviours of various classes.

```typescript
interface IPrint {
    print(): void;
}

function printClass(a: IPrint) {
    a.print();
}

class ClassA extends IPrint {
    print() { console.log(`ClassA.print()`) };
}

class ClassB extends IPrint {
    print() { console.log(`ClassB.print()`) };
}
```
