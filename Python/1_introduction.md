# Python introduction

## __main.py\__

In some cases we will want to run a directory full of code instead of just a file. Adding this file to said directory will allow to run the whole directory.

We can alternatively create this with `python -m your package`.  

## __init.py\__ (deprecated)

Python is able to define two types of packages:

### Regular packages
 Traditional packages, not needed after 3.3 and they implemented the `__init__.py` file in the directory.
   
 [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages) 

### Namespaces packages
